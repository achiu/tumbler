[4:53pm] nesquena: the issue is that when using :git => "xxx" in gemfile, bundler is relying on the dynamic gemspec directly
[4:53pm] nesquena: but its not clear to me why this causes everything to break hard

[4:55pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: i noticed tumbler relies on a VERSION file similar to jeweler. for some reason i have heard multiple people recommend using a version.rb file with a GemName::Version syntax instead. have you ever heard that before?
[4:55pm] nesquena: heres where padrino moved from VERSION to a version.rb: http://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issuesearch?state=closed&q=version#issue/88
[4:55pm] nesquena: and where sinatra did: http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/commit/e1638a43ad3a5c5ea70db56944a5230cc86e537a

[4:55pm] joshbuddy: nesquena: oh, well, i'll just follow that then
[4:55pm] joshbuddy: should be easy to change
[4:56pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: yea seems like it has partially to do with rip only taking the lib folder
[4:56pm] joshbuddy: not sure why its best practice though
[4:56pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: so any attempt to read version fails miserably
[4:56pm] joshbuddy: oh, i suppose thats valid
[4:56pm] joshbuddy: i'll fix that, thanks!
[4:56pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: sure, they sort of discuss it in the comments here: http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/commit/e1638a43ad3a5c5ea70db56944a5230cc86e537a
[4:56pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: isnt a big deal but thot id let you know since id like padrino to use tumbler too!
[4:57pm] joshbuddy: well, i'd like to follow the current state of the art
[4:57pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: yea i figured as much. tumbler is looking awesome
[4:58pm] joshbuddy: thanks! just wanna finish it already!
[4:58pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: and i would love to put it into padrino for 0.9.12
[4:58pm] joshbuddy: uup
[4:58pm] joshbuddy: thats the goal
[4:58pm] joshbuddy: and raise everyone's boats
[4:59pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: yea i can easily see it taking over for jeweler once the kinks are worked out
[4:59pm] joshbuddy: yeah, exactly.
[4:59pm] joshbuddy: but i don't want to release until it does what it minimially promises
[4:59pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: we should definately put it on rubyflow, im even down to write a padrino blog post about it or you are welcome to also
[4:59pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: yea definately
[4:59pm] joshbuddy: and the key there, is really really good testing
[4:59pm] joshbuddy: yup
[5:01pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: in padrino the way we update version is just to gsub it into the version.rb file:
[5:01pm] nesquena: version_text = File.read(version_path).sub(/VERSION = '[\d\.]+'/, "VERSION = '#{args.version}'")
[5:01pm] nesquena: not sure its the best but it gets the job done
[5:01pm] joshbuddy: i'll do something like it for now ..
[5:02pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: yea you can even keep the sytax
[5:03pm] nesquena: use_version do
[5:03pm] nesquena:     filename 'padrino-core/lib/version.rb'
[5:03pm] nesquena:   end
[5:03pm] joshbuddy: thats exactly what i'm thinkin' 
[5:03pm] RichGuk: Man you guys talk to quick.
[5:03pm] RichGuk: *reads up*
[5:03pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: although im not sure thats better than version_file 'padrino-core/lib/version.rb'
[5:03pm] nesquena: more dsl declarative
[5:04pm] joshbuddy: well, i suspect there are other version options ..
[5:04pm] joshbuddy: in fact, there are ..
[5:04pm] joshbuddy: its not documented yet, but you can have fields in there..
[5:04pm] joshbuddy: to indicate which version fields you want to be able to act one
[5:04pm] joshbuddy: on
[5:06pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: what do you mean which to act on? like major, tiny, minor?
[5:06pm] nesquena: what about something like: joshbuddy: i was
[5:06pm] nesquena: http://gist.github.com/441270
[5:06pm] joshbuddy: nesquena: exactly
[5:06pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: ok not a big deal, works either way
[5:06pm] joshbuddy: oh, thats nicer!
[5:06pm] joshbuddy: but _file ..
[5:07pm] joshbuddy: seems odd ..
[5:07pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: yea because i think in the 80% case it will be much cleaner
[5:07pm] joshbuddy: when changelog doesn't get it too
[5:07pm] nesquena: joshbuddy: ok just version then
[5:07pm] joshbuddy: nono, i'm thinking changelog_file
[5:07pm] joshbuddy:
[5:07pm] nesquena: http://gist.github.com/441270
[5:07pm] nesquena: oh
[5:07pm] nesquena: haha
[5:07pm] nesquena: yea that makes sense. i think that looks pretty clean
